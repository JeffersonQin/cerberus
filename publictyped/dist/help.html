<h1 id="cerberus">Cerberus</h1>
<p>Cerberus is a tool for exploring the semantics of C the programming language. C remains central to our computing infrastructure but still lacks a clear and complete semantics. Programmers lack tools to explore the range of behaviours they should expect; compiler development lacks test oracles; and formal verification and analysis must make (explicitly or implicitly) many choices about the specific C they target. The ISO standards for C have been developed over many years but they remain unclear in some important respects, and in some areas there are differences between the properties of C that are relied on by the corpus of systems code in production, the properties that compiler implementers aim to provide, and the properties of C as it is specified in ISO C11.</p>
<p>The Cerberus project is developing a semantic model for a substantial fragment of C. It has several distinctive features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where the ISO C11 standard is clear and corresponds with practice, Cerberus aims to follow that.</li>
<li>Where there are differences, chiefly in the <em>memory layout model</em> (the behaviour of pointers, pointer arithmetic, uninitialised values, etc.), we aim to clarify the de facto standards and understand how the ISO standard could be reconciled with them.</li>
<li>Cerberus precisely defines a range of allowed behaviour, not just that of some specific implementation.</li>
<li>It is executable, to explore all behaviours or single paths of small test programs.</li>
<li>It is designed to be integrated with an operational model for C11 concurrency, with a mechanised proof of equivalence to the axiomatic C11 model of Batty et al.</li>
<li>Its thread-local semantics is factored via an elaboration into a simpler Core language, to make it readable and conceptually and mathematically tractable; the dynamic semantics of Core can be linked with our sequential memory layout model or with that operational concurrency model.</li>
<li>Its front-end is written from scratch to closely follow the C11 standard, including a parser that follows the C11 standard grammar, and a typechecker.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a step towards a clear, consistent, and unambiguous semantics for C.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>To use the web version:</p>
<h3 id="loading-a-program">Loading a program</h3>
<p>Load a test program, either by uploading a C file in <code>File &gt; Load from file</code> or by writing a test program directly. We also have a list of tests that illustrate corner cases of the semantics, you can load these in <code>File &gt; Load defacto test</code>.</p>
<h3 id="elaboration">Elaboration</h3>
<p>Cerberus will immediately try to elaborate the code into Core, a functional intermediate representation, and show it in a different tab. Core is intended to be as minimal as possible while remaining a suitable target for the elaboration, and with the behaviour of Core programs made as explicit as possible. For further information about Core, please check <a href="#papers">Papers</a>.</p>
<p>Every C expression is then highlighted with the corresponding Core code of the same colour. Move the cursor on an expression to isolate the colour in that particular expression. The colouring behaviour can be changed in <code>Settings &gt; Colour</code> and <code>Settings &gt; Coulour Cursor</code>.</p>

<p><img src="img/core_return.png" /></p>
<p>In this little example, Cerberus binds a pure specified value <code>42</code> into the label <code>a_81</code>, then kills the reference <code>x</code>, since it is going out of scope, converts the value in <code>a_81</code> to a <code>signed int</code> and finally returns the corresponding value.</p>
<p>The interface also allows you to see the abstract syntax tree of all the Cerberus pipeline: Cabs (C Abstract) and Ail (Abstract Intermediate Language). One can check them in <code>Elaborate &gt; Cabs</code> and <code>Elaborate &gt; Ail</code>.</p>
<p><img src="img/ail.png" /></p>
<p>Whenever possible, Ail and Core ASTs may contain <em>ISO C standard annotations</em>. These justify the type-checking and elaboration. One can readily read the relevant part of the standard by clicking on it.</p>
<h3 id="execution">Execution</h3>
<p>Cerberus is a executable semantics. There are three execution mode in Cerberus: <code>Random</code>, <code>Exhaustive</code> and <code>Interactive</code>.The latter is still in development. In random mode Cerberus pseudorandomly explores a single allowed execution path, while in exhaustive mode it performs an exhaustive search for all allowed executions and can detect undefined behaviours on any allowed execution path.</p>
<p><img src="img/exec.png" /></p>
<p>In our previous example, when running Cerberus in exhaustive mode, two outcomes are possible: the conditional at line <code>3</code> is randomly evaluated to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>, since <code>x</code> is an <code>undefined value</code>.</p>
<h3 id="compiling">Compiling</h3>
<p>Cerberus is integrated with Matt Godbolt’s <a href="https://godbolt.org">Compiler Explorer</a>. One can immediately check the compilation by major compilers (Clang/GCC) to different targets (x86/ARM).</p>
