# Installation instructions for CN

Below are the installation instructions for installing Cerberus, CN,
and their dependencies.


1. Install a recent version of OCaml (we are using 4.12.0) and the opam
package manager for OCaml, following the instructions at
<https://ocaml.org/docs/install.html>. (Remember to initialise opam
via `opam init` after the installation of opam.)

2. Install the GMP and MPFR libraries, and Python (a dependency of
   Z3). On a Ubuntu system this is done via `sudo apt install libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev python2.7` .

3. Install the `dune` OCaml build system and Lem via 
  
    ```
    opam install dune lem
    ```

4. Obtain a copy of Cerberus (including CN) by running

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/rems-project/cerberus.git
    ```

5. In the downloaded `cerberus` directory run the following opam
   command to install CN's opam-package dependencies, including
   Z3. (Installation of Z3 usually takes relatively long.)

    ```
    opam install --deps-only ./cerberus-lib.opam ./cn.opam
    ```

6. then run

   ```
   make install
   ``` 
   
   and finally 
   
   ```
   make install_cn
   ``` 
   
   which installs Cerberus, CN, and dependencies.
