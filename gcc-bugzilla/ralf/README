Hi Kayvan,

here are the bugreports we made against LLVM and GCC as part of our memory model
work -- these may be interesting testcases for your semantics:

We are fairly sure these are bugs (source program is UB-free):
https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=34548
https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=35229

Some interesting questions arise in:
https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=37469 (around char *)
https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=39846 (around restrict)
https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=35102 (this is only a counterexample in C
if inttoptrcast is not UB/poison if the pointer is non-allocated)

For GCC we just have:
https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=65752
https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=82282

Btw, it'd be great if you could send me those examples that demonstrate that ptr
equality or ptr order is non-deterministic.

Kind regards,
Ralf
