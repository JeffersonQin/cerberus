The execution of simple core programs (no indet exprs) seems to be working but
the buggy hack with core_simpl makes things hard to play with for anything
interesting (e.g. arithmetic operations: for some reason it doesn't understand
that the overflow function is pure ...)
(I'm working on a parser for Core)

For entertainment, the following (impressive) C program works:

int main(void) {
  int x = 42, y = 1;
  return 0;
}

assuming it is in the file a.c

run csem using:

$ csem --print-core --graph a.c

This prints in the stdout the generated core program (the crappy original
version and then the simplified one)

then prints the traces of the 4 possible executions

and generates a file "a.c.dot" with the sb orders corresponding to each trace
(here they all have the same order)

(to get a pdf: dot -Tpdf a.c.dot > a_sb.pdf)
