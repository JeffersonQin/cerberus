- connect back together 

  -- turn on symbolic stuff (either use Z3 through console, or use
     Kayvan's very incomplete solver)

  -- include being able to run in sequential mode

- run litmus tests that we had for popl (and fix some bug that we had
  before)

- hand-written driver for non-exhaustive interactive use

  -- get concurrency model to announce what it's doing

- consume

- (more important than consume) mixed-size for nonatomics 

- (mention oota and concurrency+undefined-beh issues)

- write paper

Kayvan:

- ail type system

- move from naive naive to real naive memory model

- faff with cabs-to-ail to make tests work
