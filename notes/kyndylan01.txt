new types (for however C does atomic _Atomic( )  and _atomic), added
to parser and types and ail

justus also has to add to typechecker

library functions for atomic loads and stores

thread creation - added to syntax and to core semantics  (both
cppmem-style and real-C-library style)


make it so existing litmus tests parse 

the type of action 'a (in csem/model/core.lem) has to have some
memory_order info added in 

think about some special treatment for thread-local variables, so as
to be able to elide those events from the user interface.  Actually C
has some _thread_local storage duration, which is
implementation-defined (but "not undefined"???) 6.2.4p4

have to identify where in the state to add the right information In
core_run.lem "module Effect = ", type "state", which uses "mem_state"
(which is what Kyndylan will have to change).  Kayvan will split the
state-monad state and the memory state.
(The Mobj in mem_value is the list of sb-predecessors?)

have to identify where to add the memory model dynamics
In core_run, perform_action calls create, alloc, kill, store, load.


Kayvan will change the monad to support backtracking
