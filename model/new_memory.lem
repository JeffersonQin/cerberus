val create_sao:        AilTypes.ctype -> t pointer_value
(*
let create typ = 
    - create a new unique id 
    - calculate the size of typ
    - call the allocator to construct a new address.  
        We'll want a choice of several allocators, including:

          - the most semantically general allocator: taking a new
             symbolic variable with constraints that the new allocation
             doesn't overlap the currently allocated (in some sense
             TBD) things

             WRT that, note 7.22.3p2 "A call to free or realloc that
             deallocates a region p of memory synchronizes with any
             allocation call that allocates all or part of the region
             p. This synchronization occurs after any access of p by
             the deallocating function, and before any such access by
             the allocating function.",   which matches what I was
             saying the other day:  we do have to make up new sw edges.    

          - a completely concrete next-address allocator (with no
             reuse on free)

        This has (somehow) to refer to and update the driver's current
        constraint set and to the concurrency model's notion of the
        currently allocated things.

        Allocation can fail if the allocator runs out of memory.  For
        create, that should give a whole-semantics failure(?) whereas
        for malloc etc the call should return null.

    - construct an updated driver memory metadata state, adding a maplet
       from the unique id to the type and address
    - construct a pointer_value from the statically_allocated_object_metadata:
        Pointer_nonnull <|
          ptr_provenance = Prov_sao (*resp. Prov_das*) of the unique id
          ptr_view_type = typ
          ptr_abstract_offset = Just [] (*resp. Nothing *)
          ptr_numeric_offset =   a symbolic zero 
          ptr_numeric_address = address injected into Symbolic.t  
        |>      
    - someone synthesises a concurrency-model Create event with the address and size
*)

val create_das:         Symbolic.symbolic -> t pointer value
(* similar to create_sao except constructing a dynamically allocated space *)
(* for calloc, core will also have to generate an initialisation write (of a char array of zeros *)
(* there's an implementation-defined choice in 7.22.3 of what to do when a zero-sized allocation is requested; that can be done in core *)


val kill_sao:          pointer_value -> t unit
val free_das:          pointer_value -> t unit

(* for objects with automatic or thread storage duration (c.f. 6.2.4),
this will presumably be called with the pointer returned by create,
and we could plumb the statically_allocated_object_id directly to here
(returning it from create).  OTOH, free() might be called with an
arbitrary pointer value. Do we want the same API call for both? *)

(* for the automatic (or thread) storage-duration case: 

   - someone synthesises a concurrency-model Kill event with the
      address and size

   - in the Standard semantics, with -pointer_lifetime_end_zap true,
      someone finds all memory locations containing a pointer with the
      same unique id (or a projected byte thereof) and for each
      synthesises a concurrency-model Write event to the Undefined
      value.
   - in the Standard semantics with -pointer_lifetime_end_zap false,
      we don't do that (we rely on the concurrency model liveness
      checking wrt Create and Kill events to check accesses using the
      pointer are legal)
   - in the Concrete semantics, we don't do that (likewise relying on
      access-time checking)

   for the free() case:

   - we have to check the pointer matches "a pointer earlier returned
      by a memory management function" (7.22.3.3p2) and that it hasn't
      been free'd (or realloc'd).  The latter is done by the
      concurrency model liveness check.  For the former, 

      - in the Standard semantics:

         ptr_view_type       ... check equal to the type from driver metadata for the id of the pointer ?
         ptr_abstract_offset ... check IN {Just [], Nothing}  ?
         ptr_numeric_offset  ... check equal a symbolic zero ?
         ptr_numeric_address ... check equal to the address from the driver metadata for the id of the pointer ? 

       then we use the size from that type
  
      - in the Concrete semantics:  

         we just use the ptr_numeric_address: there should be an
         hb-visible Create with that address (and no hb-intervening or
         hb-unordered Kill on it)

       then we use the size from that Create

   - Then we use that address and size to synthesise a Kill event. 

   - In the Standard semantics with -pointer_lifetime_end_zap true, we
      synthesise undefined-value writes as above.
*)

val load:          AilTypes.ctype -> pointer_value -> t object_value

(* in the Standard semantics:

   - check non-null

   - either (reading a representation byte from an sao or das)
  
      - the ctype is char
      - according to the ptr_numeric_offset and ptr_numeric_address the pointer points to somewhere in the footprint (padding included) of the original object (sao or das) (from the ptr_provenance)
     
   - or (reading a normal subobject member from a statically allocated object)
    
      - the ptr_provenance is an sao

      - according to the ptr_abstract_offset the pointer points to the
         original object or a subobject thereof (and not one of those
         one-past things), which matches the ptr_view_type and the
         ctype

   - or (reading a not-necessarily-char from a dynamically allocated space)

      - the ptr_provenance is a das

      - some check wrt its ptr_view_type ? 

      - according to the ptr_numeric_offset, the pointer points to
         somewhere within the das (far enough from the end to fit the
         ctype)

      - all other checking is left to the effective type
         checking below

   in the Concrete semantics:

    - check non-null

    - nothing more, beyond the effective-type checking below?  (and modulate that by only looking at the leaf types and by optionally allowing representation casts)?
*)

(*When we do a (nonatomic) read, we expect the concurrency model to
calculate the set of hb-most-recent writes (do I really mean hb?)
that overlap the read location.  Presumably any of those writes that
pairwise-overlap each other are themselves hb-related, otherwise we'd
have already found a data race (but there might be a struct write and
an hb-later member write, or an abstract value write and an hb-later
representation-byte write, for example).  Then we need to reassemble
the read value from that partial order of write values.  (which may be
tricky if many things are symbolic...)

What does "overlap the read location" really mean?  I've been
imagining it was just overlap of (address,size) intervals (computing
the size from the lvalue type and taking the address from the pointer
value), but that's wrong: if we're reading a compound value as an
abstract thing (i.e. not just as a char array), we should *not* be
reading the padding, and should not get rf edges from padding writes
etc.

In the Standard semantics, we also need to do effective-type checking:
checking for each of the pieces of that reassembly that the type of
the write is suitably compatible with the lvalue type of the load.

In the Concrete semantics, do we do any type checking?  At least that
we're not reading from non-allocated memory - but that follows from
the concurrency model?

Then someone has to synthesise a read event (or however this works in
Kyndylan's current interface), and we rely on the concurrency model
lifetime check (w.r.t. *all* the writes we read from).

*)


val store:         AilTypes.ctype -> pointer_value -> object_value -> t unit

(* This is relatively straightforward: we basically just synthesise a Write
event, after some checks similar to the load.  

In the Standard semantics we can look at the pointer_value to
determined if we're writing to a statically allocated object (in which
case the lvalue type should be suitably compatible with that) or to
within a dynamically allocated space, in which case we use the
supplied lvalue type as the effective type of the write.
