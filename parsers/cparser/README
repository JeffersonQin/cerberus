The state of this directory is post the application of the Makefile, so nothing
should be done. If you nevertheless want to apply the Makefile, you will need:

  - menhir (tested with version 20120123)
  - Coq (version 8.4 works for coq_stdlib, but NOT validator/ where a 64bits 8.3pl3
         is needed instead)

NOTE: the requirement for a 64bits version of Coq 8.3pl3 comes from the fact that
      some Coq Definition generated by menhir is longer (in chars) than the maximum
      length of a string in 32bits OCaml, and as a result Coq crashes because it uses
      String.create when it parses a Definition...
