ยง6.7.6.2#4, 2nd sentence: 
4   If the size is not present, the array type is an incomplete type. If the size is * instead of
    being an expression, the array type is a variable length array type of unspecified size,
    which can only be used in declarations or type names with function prototype scope;143)
    such arrays are nonetheless complete types. If the size is an integer constant expression
    and the element type has a known constant size, the array type is not a variable length
    array type; otherwise, the array type is a variable length array type. (Variable length
    arrays are a conditional feature that implementations need not support; see 6.10.8.3.)
