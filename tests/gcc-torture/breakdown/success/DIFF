NOTE: all these tests have been preprocessed by running the following command:

  cproto -a -q -E 0

it converts function definitions from the old style to the ANSI C style, e.g.:

  foo(x)
    int x;
  { ... }

becomes

  int foo(int x)
  { ... }

================================================================================

ADDITIONAL DIFF MADE BY HAND

[conversion.c]
  
  the return types of the functions:
    - test_integer_to_float
    - test_longlong_integer_to_float
    - test_float_to_integer
    - test_float_to_longlong_integer

  have been changed from int to void, since they do not have any return
  statement, leading to undefined behaviour without the diff.
