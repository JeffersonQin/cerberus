3   There shall be no more than one external definition for each identifier declared with
    internal linkage in a translation unit. Moreover, if an identifier declared with internal
    linkage is used in an expression (other than as a part of the operand of a sizeof or
    _Alignof operator whose result is an integer constant), there shall be exactly one
    external definition for the identifier in the translation unit.
