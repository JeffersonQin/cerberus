ยง6.7.2.1#3, sentence 1: 
3   A structure or union shall not contain a member with incomplete or function type (hence,
    a structure shall not contain an instance of itself, but may contain a pointer to an instance
    of itself), except that the last member of a structure with more than one named member
    may have incomplete array type; such a structure (and any union containing, possibly
    recursively, a member that is such a structure) shall not be a member of a structure or an
    element of an array.
