{- The coherence axioms CoWW and CoWR forbid that the load reads from the first write. 
   The only allowed outcome is therefore 1. The diference with the test coherence+rel_rel_acq is 
   that a thread is created between the first and second write, and the test will only succeed
   if the operational semantics creates the correct asw edges.
