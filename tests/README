fail

abort                  19   surprising control-flow path - maybe Cerb bug
ail-typing             29   Cerb bug - desugaring problem (mostly array init?) - aiming to fix
desugaring             18   crash during desugaring before producing Ail
elaboration             3   crash during elaboration
eval                   32   crash during core evaluation (run without Core typechecking)
exceptional-condition  15   Cerb reported an UB during execution - need to check
funct-ptr              11   [DEPRIORITSE] Cerb has an error core_aux.core_object_type_of_ctype...  function pointers not elaborated properly
ill-formed             14   at runtime core was not well typed
internal               10   OCaml threw an exception
missing-std-func        8   sprintf hard to do properly to streams - but can do to memory buffers? 
parsing                77   think these are all/mostly GNU extensions - some need hand-written prototypes
stack-overflow         16   just need to run on Linux
undefined              14   Cerb reported an UB during execution - need to check

success

733 pass in script, but in Jenkins randomly some change (approx 7)
  pr43629.c is an interesting de facto point - bitwise initialisation - we should talk about those in the paper.

  to make it easier to find, make cerberus announce branches on unspec value.


RV-match say pass 99.2% of 726    770 of 776 - discussed in POPL 2012.  Probably more since then. 


ABORT
=====

20010904-1.c and 20010904-2.c: They use _Alignas inside a struct, which is not allowed by the C11 standard. DR444 adds it to the grammar.

20021127-1.c: The test is wrong! It calls a function that simply aborts.

950605-1.c: Incorrect! -1 != 0xFF

pr23467.c: _Alignas inside a struct
