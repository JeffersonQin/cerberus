<p>C remains central to our computing infrastructure but still lacks a clear and complete semantics. Programmers lack tools to explore the range of behaviours they should expect; compiler development lacks test oracles; and formal verification and analysis must make (explicitly or implicitly) many choices about the specific C they target. The ISO standards for C have been developed over many years but they remain unclear in some important respects, and in some areas there are differences between the properties of C that are relied on by the corpus of systems code in production, the properties that compiler implementers aim to provide, and the properties of C as it is specified in ISO C11.</p>
<p>The Cerberus project is developing a semantic model for a substantial fragment of C. It has several distinctive features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where the ISO C11 standard is clear and corresponds with practice, Cerberus aims to follow that.</li>
<li>Where there are differences, chiefly in the <em>memory layout model</em> (the behaviour of pointers, pointer arithmetic, uninitialised values, etc.), we aim to clarify the de facto standards and understand how the ISO standard could be reconciled with them.</li>
<li>Cerberus precisely defines a range of allowed behaviour, not just that of some specific implementation.</li>
<li>It is executable, to explore all behaviours or single paths of small test programs.</li>
<li>It is designed to be integrated with an operational model for C11 concurrency, with a mechanised proof of equivalence to the axiomatic C11 model of Batty et al.</li>
<li>Its thread-local semantics is factored via an elaboration into a simpler Core language, to make it readable and conceptually and mathematically tractable; the dynamic semantics of Core can be linked with our sequential memory layout model or with that operational concurrency model.</li>
<li>Its front-end is written from scratch to closely follow the C11 standard, including a parser that follows the C11 standard grammar, and a typechecker.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a step towards a clear, consistent, and unambiguous semantics for C.</p>

<p>To use the web version:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Upload</strong>: Upload a C file to be use by Cerberus.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Download</strong>: Download a C source file, a Core file, a .dot file represing the execution graph or a log file of executions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>View</strong>: Create new tabs, split a pane in two or rearrange the tabs into a single pane.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Run</strong>: Execute the C program in <em>random mode</em> or <em>exhaustive mode</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Core File</strong>: Create a Core file from the C program. It hightlights the elaboration of every C expression into a Core expression. One can also select the precise expression to see its elaboration.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Execution Graph</strong>: Create the execution graph of the program with all possible executions.</p></li>

<p>The current main developers are Kayvan Memarian, Victor Gomes, and Kyndylan Nienhuis. Cerberus originated with Justus Matthiesen's 2010-11 Part II project dissertation and his 2011-12 MPhil dissertation; James Lingard's 2013-14 MPhil dissertation developed a certifying translation validator for simple C programs for the Clang front-end, w.r.t. the Cerberus and Vellvm semantics.</p>
