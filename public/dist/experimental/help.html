<h2>What does this experimental data mean?</h2>

This is experimental data from compiling and running our C memory
object model tests on various C implementations and analysis tools. 


<h3>The tests</h3>
Our test cases are typically written to illustrate a particular
semantic question as concisely as possible.  Some are 
"natural" examples, of desirable C code that one might find in the
wild, but many are intentionally pathological or are corner cases, to explore just where the
defined/undefined-behaviour boundary is; we are <em>not</em>
suggesting that all these should be supported. 
<p>

Making the tests concise to illustrate semantic questions also means
that most are not written to trigger interesting
compiler behaviour, which might only occur in a
larger context that permits some analysis or optimisation pass to take
effect. Moreover, following the
spirit of C, conventional implementations cannot and do not report all instances of undefined
behaviour. Hence, only in
some cases is there anything to be learned from the experimental
compiler behaviour.  For any executable semantics or analysis tool, on the other hand,
all the tests should have  instructive outcomes. 
<p>

Some tests rely on address coincidences for the interesting
execution; for these we sometimes include multiple variants, tuned to the
allocation behaviour in the implementations we consider.  Where this
has not been done, some of the experimental data is not meaningful.

<h3>The platforms</h3>
The tests have been run with a range of tools:
<ul>
<li> GCC 8.1, clang 6.0, and ICC 19.0.0.117, at O0, O2, and O3; the latter two with and without
<code>-fno-strict-aliasing</code>, on x86_64 on linux, e.g.
<pre>
gcc -O2 -std=c11 -pedantic -Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-variable -pthread
</pre>

<li> clang 6.0 with address, memory, and undefined-behaviour sanitisers, e.g.
<pre>
clang -fsanitize=address -O2 -std=c11 -pedantic -Wall -Wextra -Wno-unused-variable -pthread
</pre>

<li> Cerberus in concrete and symbolic modes

<li> CHERI, with various compiler and configuration options

<!--<li> the TrustInSoft tis-interpreter tool, version Magnesium-20151002+dev-->

<li> the RV-Match tool, 
in the Vagrant VM distribution of RV-Match v1.0 by Runtime Verification Inc.
<a href="https://runtimeverification.com/match/1.0/docs/vagrant/">here</a>,
downloaded 2018-05-03

<li> the CH2O tool

<li> CompCert 3.4, compiling with and without -O, and running the interpreter



</ul>


<h3>The Charon test harness </h3>

The tests are run using a test harness, charon, that generates
individual test instances from JSON files describing the tests and
tools; charon logs all the compile and execution output (together with
the test itself and information about the host) to another JSON file
for analysis.  The tests and harness can be packaged up in a single
tarball that can be run easily.  charon also supports
cross-compilation, to let the tests be compiled on a normal host and
executed on other hardware.
