### Discuss of results

The Toyota tests were written to test static analysers. A lot of these tests
are technically correct C code but morally wrong. For example, they
contain an unused variable or a redundant condition in a conditional statement.

The follow test files are outside of the scope of Cerberus:

- Contradict conditions
- Integer precision lost because of cast
- Deletion of data structure sentinel
- Return value of function never checked
- Useless assignment 
- Unused variable
- Memory leakage
- Memory copy at overlapping areas
- Non void function does not return value
- Integer sign lost because of unsigned cast

The following is C++:

- Improper error handling

In the following file, the tests assume a memory capacity of `UINT_MAX`, which
is not always true:

- Memory allocation failure

The following files contain code that the tests judge wrong, but are
technically correct:

- Invalid memory access to already freed area
- Free NULL pointer
- Incorrect pointer arithmetic
- Double free

An example is the following (which is correct in C11):
```c
void ptr_subtraction_002 ()
{
  int x= 10;
  int *ptr = &x;
  char *buf ;
  buf= (char *)(ptr+1); /*Tool should detect this line as error*/
  /*ERROR:Incorrect pointer arithmetic*/
}
```

The following tests are invalided due to Cerberus unspecified values semantics:

- Uninitialized variable
- Uninitialized pointer
- Uninitialized memory

In the last file, for example, the tests consider incorrect calling `printf` with
uninitialised memory.

### Things Cerberus should improve

We should be able to detect:

- Data overflow
- Data underflow
